Technical Documentation: Crawling and Scraping for Market Research

Overview

This documentation outlines the technical process of crawling and scraping data from online sources to analyze market trends, business software usage, and customer behavior. The methodology includes data extraction, automated browsing, and software identification.

Data Collection Process

1. Crawling Business Data with Octoparse

Extract business information from Google Maps, including:

Business name

Address

Website

Ratings and reviews

Crawl all reviews associated with each business.

Estimate customer volume and revenue using:

Average ticket size.

Customer-review ratio (typically 5-10%).

2. Identifying Online Booking Systems

Use Cursor and Selenium to:

Visit business websites.

Search for booking-related text ("Book Now," "Schedule Appointment," etc.).

Extract booking page links.

Analyze extracted URLs to identify subdomain patterns indicating software providers (e.g., appname.booking.clinicname.com).

3. Advanced Software Identification

Clean and filter extracted URLs.

Identify and count recurring booking software providers.

Visit booking pages without an identifiable subdomain to analyze source code for software-related keywords.

Match businesses to their booking software providers.

Data Analysis & Insights

SQL tables store extracted data for easy querying and visualization.

Key statistics generated include:

Most-used booking software in the market.

Relationship between revenue and software usage.

Age of businesses using different booking systems (estimated from earliest review dates).

Findings provide insights into:

Market penetration of specific software.

Technology adoption trends.

Scraping Additional Data for AI Applications

Extract treatment catalogs from businesses with publicly available data (treatment name, description, price, duration, etc.).

Structure scraped data into a formatted knowledge base for AI applications.

Automate data refinement using pre-tested prompts.

Broader Industry Applications

The methodology described is applicable across various industries for competitive analysis and automation, including:

Car Dealerships – Identifying dealerships with online booking for test drives or service appointments.

Dentists – Analyzing clinic booking systems and patient volume.

Hospitals – Evaluating appointment scheduling and patient management software.

Restaurants – Detecting online reservation systems and food delivery platform usage (e.g., Uber Eats, OpenTable).

This technical approach enables efficient data-driven decision-making and market analysis through automation and AI integration.
