## Data Collection Process

### 1. Crawling Business Data with Octoparse
- Extract business information from Google Maps, including:
  - **Business name**
  - **Address**
  - **Website**
  - **Ratings and reviews**
- Crawl all reviews associated with each business.
- Estimate customer volume and revenue using:
  - **Average ticket size**
  - **Customer-review ratio** (typically 5-10%)

### 2. Identifying Online Booking Systems
- Use **Cursor** and **Selenium** to:
  - Visit business websites.
  - Search for booking-related text ("Book Now," "Schedule Appointment," etc.).
  - Extract booking page links.
- Analyze extracted URLs to identify subdomain patterns indicating software providers (e.g., `appname.booking.clinicname.com`).

### 3. Advanced Software Identification
- Clean and filter extracted URLs.
- Identify and count recurring booking software providers.
- Visit booking pages without an identifiable subdomain to analyze source code for software-related keywords.
- Match businesses to their booking software providers.

## Data Analysis & Insights
- **SQL tables** store extracted data for easy querying and visualization.
- Key statistics generated include:
  - Most-used **booking software** in the market.
  - Relationship between **revenue and software usage**.
  - Age of businesses using different booking systems (estimated from earliest review dates).
- Findings provide insights into:
  - Market penetration of specific software.
  - Technology adoption trends.

## Scraping Additional Data for AI Applications
- Extract **treatment catalogs** from businesses with publicly available data (treatment name, description, price, duration, etc.).
- Structure scraped data into a formatted **knowledge base** for AI applications.
- Automate data refinement using **pre-tested prompts**.

## Broader Industry Applications
This methodology is applicable across various industries for competitive analysis and automation, including:

- **Car Dealerships** â€“ Identifying dealerships with online booking for test drives or service appointments.
- **Dentists** â€“ Analyzing clinic booking systems and patient volume.
- **Hospitals** â€“ Evaluating appointment scheduling and patient management software.
- **Restaurants** â€“ Detecting online reservation systems and food delivery platform usage (e.g., Uber Eats, OpenTable).

This approach enables efficient **data-driven decision-making** and market analysis through automation and AI integration.
