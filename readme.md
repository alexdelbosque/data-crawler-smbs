## Data Collection Process

### 1. Crawling Business Data with Octoparse
- Crawl all businesses using Octoparse by generating keyword lists for all cities and states in the US, modifying them with relevant keywords (e.g., "Botox in Washington DC", "Facials in San Francisco, California").
- These iterations ensure all relevant businesses are captured.
- Clean the data to remove potential duplicates.
- Import the cleaned data into the **clinics_usa** table using the `create_clinics_table` script.

### 2. Crawling Business Reviews
- Use Octoparse to crawl reviews from the Google Maps listings.
- Upload the reviews to the **clinics_usa_reviews** table using the `create_reviews_table` script.
- Convert review timestamps (e.g., "9 months ago", "2 years ago") into a standard date format based on the import date.

### 3. Identifying Online Booking Systems
- Use **Cursor** and **Selenium** to:
  - Visit business websites.
  - Search for booking-related text ("Book Now," "Schedule Appointment," etc.).
  - Extract booking page links.
- Store the results in the **website_scraping** table using the `find_booking_buttons` script.

### 4. Analyzing Booking Software Patterns
- Analyze extracted URLs to identify subdomain patterns indicating software providers using the `url_pattern_analysis` script.
- Manually clean and define software categories.
- Upload the cleaned data into the **software** table using the `import_softwares` script.
- Match businesses to their software providers using the `match_software` script.

## Data Cleaning & Storage
- To store and process data efficiently, create the following SQL tables:
  - **clinics_usa** â€“ Stores business information from Google Maps.
  - **clinics_usa_reviews** â€“ Stores customer reviews, ratings, and review dates.
  - **software** â€“ Stores identified booking software providers and their usage statistics.
  - **website_scraping** â€“ Stores results from website scraping, including booking button detection.
- **Review Date Conversion:**
  - Google Maps provides review timestamps in text format (e.g., "9 months ago" or "2 years ago").
  - Convert these timestamps into a standard date format using the data import timestamp.
  - Example logic:
    - If the current date is `2024-02-01` and a review says "2 years ago," it is converted to `2022-02-01`.
    - If a review says "9 months ago," it is converted to `2023-05-01`.

## Data Analysis & Insights
- **SQL tables** store extracted data for easy querying and visualization.
- Key statistics generated include:
  - Most-used **booking software** in the market.
  - Relationship between **revenue and software usage**.
  - Age of businesses using different booking systems (estimated from earliest review dates).
- Findings provide insights into:
  - Market penetration of specific software.
  - Technology adoption trends.

## Scraping Additional Data for AI Applications
- Extract **treatment catalogs** from businesses with publicly available data (treatment name, description, price, duration, etc.).
- Structure scraped data into a formatted **knowledge base** for AI applications.
- Automate data refinement using **pre-tested prompts**.

## Broader Industry Applications
This methodology is applicable across various industries for competitive analysis and automation, including:

- **Car Dealerships** â€“ Identifying dealerships with online booking for test drives or service appointments.
- **Dentists** â€“ Analyzing clinic booking systems and patient volume.
- **Hospitals** â€“ Evaluating appointment scheduling and patient management software.
- **Restaurants** â€“ Detecting online reservation systems and food delivery platform usage (e.g., Uber Eats, OpenTable).

This approach enables efficient **data-driven decision-making** and market analysis through automation and AI integration.

## Sample Data
- The repository contains **CSV files** with sample data for each of the tables mentioned:
  - `clinics_usa.csv`
  - `clinics_usa_reviews.csv`
  - `software.csv`
  - `website_scraping.csv`
- These files provide example data to understand the structure and format of the collected information.
